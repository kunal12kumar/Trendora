                            In case our courier partner does not have a return pickup service in your pin code, then we would inform you and you would need to arrange for a return for the items yourself.

                        <p>
                            Orders can be cancelled if the request is made within a few hours of the order being placed and your order hasn't been packed/ dispatched. Normally, once an order is placed, it immediately goes to into our warehouse for fulfillment and thus cannot be changed. Additionally, promotional and discount codes cannot be applied post-order, nor can their effects.
